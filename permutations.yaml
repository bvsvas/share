The requested Java version **30** is not a valid or supported release according to the provided data. The most recent feature version listed in your input is **25**, with **26** being the tip version. Java 30 does not exist in the provided `available_releases` or `available_lts_releases`, and therefore, it is **unsupported**.

As a result, I cannot generate permutations for Java 30. Please provide a valid and supported Java version (e.g., from `available_releases` or `available_lts_releases`) for generating the compatibility matrix.
